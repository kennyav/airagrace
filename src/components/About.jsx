        I wanted to create this website so you could have a place to look back on all the your memories of being 24.
        I hope that this year has been memorable for you and I look forward to creating new ones as we grow together. It is nice
        to have reminders of how far we have come, for me at least, I like to remember the different mindset arcs and try to understand 
        how each of those added to who I am. I am trying not to get philosophical with this and I think I am doing a 
        pretty good job towing the line. Regardless, I reached out to most of your friends and asked them to provide
        photos throughout or you together this year, I haven't seen them all yet but I bet it is cool to see yourself and how loved you are
        from all these different perspectives. I think I am going to show this to you the morning of your Birthday so here are 
        a couple final remarks, good morning I will show you all your presents now, even the ones that haven't come in yet, I Love
        You and Happy Birthday!
